### Simplified Explanation:
When designing a system, it's essential to think about how the data will be organized and accessed. In job interviews, especially for technical roles, interviewers often ask questions that are about both how you would design a system and how you would use algorithms and data structures. These questions test your basic computer science knowledge.

I can go over the key data structures (like arrays, linked lists, etc.), search methods (like binary search), and sorting methods (like quicksort and mergesort) that you should know. I'll also explain the "Big O" notation, which is a way to describe how efficient these methods are. This should help refresh your memory on these computer science topics, which might be important in a system design interview.

### Technical Terms Explained:
- **Data Structures**: Ways to organize and store data so that it can be accessed and used efficiently. Examples include arrays, linked lists, trees, and hash tables.
  
- **Search Algorithms**: Methods used to find specific data within a structure. For example, a binary search is a fast way to find an item in a sorted list.
  
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Techniques to arrange data in a specific order, like ascending or descending. For example, quicksort and mergesort are popular sorting methods.

- **Big O Notation**: A way to describe how the performance of an algorithm changes as the size of the data grows. For example, an algorithm with O(n) complexity means that the time it takes to complete will grow linearly with the size of the input data.

### Examples to Understand Better:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - **Array**: Imagine a list of students' names. You can quickly find a student's name by their position in the list.
   - **Linked List**: Think of a chain of connected items. If one student points to the next student, you can go from one student to another, but you might have to go through each one to find the one you're looking for.

2. **Search Algorithms**:
   - **Binary Search**: Suppose you have a dictionary, and you want to find the word "Apple." Instead of flipping through every page, you open the book in the middle. If "Apple" comes before the middle, you know to look in the first half. You keep doing this, cutting the search area in half until you find the word.

3. **Sorting Algorithms**:
   - **Quicksort**: Imagine sorting a deck of cards. You pick a random card (like picking a "pivot" in quicksort), then divide the other cards into two piles: those less than the pivot and those greater. You repeat this process for each pile until everything is sorted.

4. **Big O Notation**:
   - **O(n)**: If you have 100 students and you want to find a particular student by checking each name one by one, it will take you up to 100 checks. If you have 200 students, it could take up to 200 checks. The time grows directly with the number of students.

### Real-Time Scenario:
Imagine you're designing a social media app like Instagram. You need to figure out how to store and retrieve users' posts quickly. You might use a data structure like a hash table to store the posts, which allows for fast access. If a user searches for a specific post, you might use a binary search to find it quickly. And if you need to display posts in a certain order, you could use a sorting algorithm like mergesort.
