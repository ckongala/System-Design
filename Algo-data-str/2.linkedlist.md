### Simplified Explanation:
We're going to review some important computer science concepts, specifically focusing on algorithms (step-by-step instructions for solving problems) and data structures (ways to organize data). Even though you might get separate interview questions about these topics, you often need to use them when solving system design problems too. So, it's worth refreshing your memory.

The goal here isn’t to teach you everything from scratch, but to remind you of the basics that you might need for an interview. If you learned computer science on your own, like many people, you might need to brush up on some of these concepts because interviewers often expect you to know them, especially if they have a computer science degree.

For example, you might not need to build a complex data structure like an LRU cache (a way to manage recently used data) from scratch in a real job, but it’s still good to understand it for interviews.

Let’s start with **linked lists**—a basic type of data structure.

### Linked Lists:
- **What is a Linked List?**
  - A **linked list** is a way to store a list of items where each item points to the next one. Unlike an array (where you reserve a fixed amount of memory), a linked list can grow as you add more items, making it flexible in terms of memory usage.
  
  - In a **singly linked list**, each item (called a "node") has a pointer to the next item. The first item is called the "head," and the last item points to "null," which means the end of the list.

#### Example:
Imagine a train where each car is linked to the next one. If you start at the engine (the head) and move through each car (each node), you’ll eventually reach the end of the train, which has no more cars (null).

### Big O Notation:
- **What is Big O Notation?**
  - Big O Notation is a way to describe how efficient an algorithm is, especially as the amount of data (N) grows. It tells you how much time or space an operation will take in the worst-case scenario.

#### Example:
If you have a linked list with N items, finding a specific item might require you to check each one, one by one, until you find it. This could take up to N steps, which is called **O(N)**. 

- **Inserting at the Head (Beginning):**
  - If you want to add a new item at the very start of the list, you just point the new item to the current head and update the head to the new item. This takes constant time, called **O(1)**, because you’re only doing a few simple operations.

- **Inserting at the End:**
  - If you want to add a new item at the end of the list, you might have to go through every item to find the end, which would take **O(N)** time.

### Use Cases for Linked Lists:
- **When to Use a Linked List?**
  - Linked lists are good for situations where you need to add or remove items frequently, especially if you only need to do so at the beginning or end.
  
  - For example, they are useful in building **stacks** (like a stack of books where you can only add or remove the top book) and **queues** (like a line of people where you serve the first person in line).

### Doubly Linked Lists:
- **What is a Doubly Linked List?**
  - A **doubly linked list** is similar to a singly linked list, but each item has two pointers: one to the next item and one to the previous item. This means you can move forward or backward through the list easily.

#### Example:
If the train from earlier had a conductor at the end, who could also point back to the engine, you could move in either direction, from engine to conductor or from conductor to engine.

- **Inserting at the Head or Tail:**
  - With a doubly linked list, you can add an item at the beginning or the end in constant time, **O(1)**, because you have pointers to both the head and the tail.

- **Accessing Items:**
  - Finding a specific item might still take **O(N)** time because you might have to search through the list, but you can start from either the head or the tail, depending on where you think the item might be.

### Real-Time Scenario Example:
Imagine you’re designing a browser history feature. You want to track the most recently visited websites so that you can quickly go back and forth. A **doubly linked list** would be great here because you can easily move forward and backward through the list of websites. You could also add a new website to the beginning or end quickly, depending on whether you’re adding it to the history or revisiting an old one.
